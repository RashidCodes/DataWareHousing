In this repo, I teach myself the essentials of datawarehousing using a book titled  Building a Data Warehouse by Vincent Rainardi. SQL server is implemented with docker.


# Process

1. Start the database server.
2. Run the scripts to create the Stage, NDS, and DDS databases.
3. Run the scripts to create the data mart relations in the DDS.
4. Run the scripts to create the relations in the NDS.
5. Restore the backup of the source system.
6. ```bcp``` the country data into the Stage database.
